# Sentimental_Analysis_Scripting
Created Sentimental Analysis Script for analyzing Sentences Sentiments
Used TextBlob for understanding the polarity of the sentences and according to the accuracy of the polarity, we are assessing the sentences as Positive, negative, and Neutral.

In this, we need to upload the file location with the file name and run the script. This Script will give the file a new column called Manual with the sentiments as 1(positive), 0(neutral), -1(Negative).

Thats it.
